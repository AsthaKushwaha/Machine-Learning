Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering you donâ€™t know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify 
some segments or clusters in your data.

Implementation of the Machine Learning Clustering models:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
